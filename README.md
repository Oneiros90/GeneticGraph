# GeneticGraph
A tool for solving NP-complete graph theory problems with Genetic Algorithms.

This tool was created in 2011 in my second year of Computer Science University in Molise. It was presented as a project in two separate exams, helping me to get full marks in both.

The purpose was to show how [Genetic Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) can give a (not optimal but) good-enough solution to [NP-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness) graph theory problems, unsolvable with classic search methods such as [Brute Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search).

In particular, the chosen problems are the classic [Travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem), the [Maximum matching problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_(graph_theory)), the [Maximum independent set problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_set_(graph_theory)), the [Minimum dominating set problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominating_set) and the [Minimum edge dominating set problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_dominating_set).

The tool has been made with Java and with the [JGAP](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jgap/) library. A very basic graph editor helps you build a graph on which you can solve NP-C problems using genetic or brute force algorithms. The solution is shown on the graph itself and in a textual box at the bottom.

Please try it yourself, the tool can be downloaded from the [release section](https://github.com/Oneiros90/GeneticGraph/releases)
